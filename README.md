# SolMate

**AI-Powered Solana Wallet & Prediction Market Platform**

SolMate is a hackathon project that combines Solana blockchain with AI to create an accessible prediction market platform. Built for MHacks 2025, it uses Gemini AI to analyze Kalshi markets and helps users make informed trading decisions with automated wallet management.
